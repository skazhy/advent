My Advent of Code solutions, [in various languages](doc/PUZZLES.md).

`aoc.sh` wraps the language specific tools to have somewhat unified API for
testing and developing puzzles. `./aoc.sh $language $day $year` sets up files
for a new puzzle & starts an interactive dev session if the given language has
such capabilities. `./aoc.sh $language $day $year test` can be used to verify
solutions.

Puzzles are self-contained scripts (except for Rust - all puzzles are compiled
to a single executable). Building the tooling sometimes is more fun than
dealing with puzzles themselves, so a bash duct tape is holding this project
together. [DEV.md](doc/DEV.md) has more detailed information about how this
all works together.

All puzzles read their input from `resources/$year/day$day.txt`, all puzzles
(except for Clojure, which uses `clojure.test`) are expected to print out
their solutions which are then compared to `resources/$year/solutions/day$day.txt`.
